<h2>Motivation:</h2>

Bored on weekends here in Delhi. Hence, decided to make a bot that helps me lighten my mood by being able to instantly get memes, motivational thoughts, jokes and tech news at one click. 


### Goals of this project:

* [x] Learn chatbot development (at least rule based)
* [x] Learn how to deal with external APIs in Messenger. 
* [x] Deal with message type other than text and how to pipeline it to corresponding user. 
* [x] Cut out boredom.
